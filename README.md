# Command Line Workshop

This workshop teaches the basics of the bash shell.  Many of the commands are similar in other shell environments, but they aren't covered here.

# Software

On Mac OSX, which is based on a Unix environment, you can use the built in terminal program (found in the Utilities folder of the Applications folder).

Windows, which is not Unix based, does not come with a bash shell.  You can [download Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which will allow you to use both git and bash on a Windows computer.  Alternatively, if you have a 64-bit version of Windows 10, you can activate a bash shell.  See [these directions](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/).  The latter option is not recommended for those who are not confident in their use of and understanding of the Windows operating system.
